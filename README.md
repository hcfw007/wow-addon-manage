# wow-addon-manage
Manage WoW addons from CurseForge.

For some reason, my Twitch Client app can no longer update and sync my addons.

## Thoughts
I did not find any open API about wow addons on CurseForge. So I'm thinking about getting info directly from HTML with request.js and cheerio.js.

## Test
Fork, Clone, npm install, node index.js

## Anything else
